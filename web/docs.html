Welcome to ApProgXimate Audio.  ApProgXimate Audio is a somewhat chaotic way of making and exploring new sounds. It's a useful method to exploring sonic spaces and finding unexpected sonic surprises.

In short, it works like this:  you provide a set of small component functions. These component functions use used as building blocks to create a larger and more complex algorithm, according to a recipe given by a set of numbers (a gene).

In this environment, the component functions you provide will change or generate sound in small simple ways, and the resulting algorithm will combine these functions to generate sound in a more complex way.

You can change the values on the gene in realtime, changing the way the components are built into an algorithm, and therefore changing the sound you will hear.

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
function myComponent() {
 	this.play = function(j0) {
 		return j0;
 	}
 }

</code></pre>

The code above demonstrates the minimum requirements for a component function. It's a function called 'play' wrapped in another function called 'myComponent'. The function 'play()' must have at least one parameter (which will be a floating point number) and must output a single number.  The function above will just pass through the variable j0, having no direct effect on the sound. Let's look a something more interesting:

<pre><code class="language-javascript">
  function saw() {
       this.osc = new Module.maxiOsc();
       this.play = function(j0) {
         return this.osc.sawn(Module.maxiMap.linexp(j0,-1,1,20,20000));
       }
     }

</code></pre>
