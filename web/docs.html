<div><h1>ApProgXimate Audio</h1></div>
Welcome to ApProgXimate Audio.  ApProgXimate Audio is a somewhat chaotic way listening of making and exploring new sounds. It's a venue to to explore sonic spaces and find unexpected sonic surprises.

You'll see plenty of code on this site, but don't worry if you do programming - you can still explore the sounds without needing to understand or write any code - just switch to 'listen mode' and try out the presets.

<h2>Approximate Programming</h2>

This site makes sound using a programming technique called Approximate Programming. In short, it works like this:  you provide a set of small component functions. These component functions use used as building blocks to create a larger and more complex algorithm, according to a recipe given by a set of numbers (a gene).

In this environment, the component functions you provide will change or generate sound in small simple ways, and the resulting algorithm will combine these functions to generate sound in a more complex way.

You can change the values on the gene in realtime, changing the way the components are built into an algorithm, and therefore changing the sound you will hear.

<h2>Modes</h2>

You can use this site in two modes - 'listen mode' and 'create mode'  - and switch between them with the button in the top right hand corner of the screen.  In 'listen mode' you can explore ready-made scenes, and manipulate the sound you are listening to with the mouse.  In 'create mode', you have full access to all the elements that are making the sound, so you can program your own.

<h2>How to Make Sounds</h2>

<div><h3>Changing the Gene</h3></div>

<div>
The bars in the centre of the screen represent the values in the gene, ranging from -1 (on the left) to 1 (on the right).  You can mode these around with the mouse.
As you change these values, the code will be re-generated and the sound will change.
</div>
<div>
You will notice that some bars are solid black and some are outlined.  These correspond two two types of node in the generated algorithm: functions and values.
When the algorithm is generated, the system keeps track of how each number in the gene relates to each bit of code.
Moving an outlined bar will change a value in the gene that relates to a function, which may (or may not) cause structural changes in the algorithm.  Making a structural change causes regeneration of the code, and a small 'dropout' in the sound while this happens.
Moving a black bar changes a variable.  This instaneously changes the sound without generating the algorithm.
</div>
<div>
Each time you move an outlined bar (causing a structural change in the algorithm),  the colours of the bars in the gene may change. This is because when you make a structural change, the pattern of functions and values in the gene changes.

<div><h3>Editing Functions</h3></div>
<div>
In the left hand column are the component functions. These are the small functions that are the building blocks of the generated algorithm.  Clicking on a function name will show the functions code. This code is editable.
