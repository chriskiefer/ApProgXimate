<div><h1>ApProgXimate Audio FAQ</h1></div>
<div><h2>Why can't I hear anything?</h2></div>
<div>There's no guarantee that the particular set of functions and a particular gene will produce any sound.  Try randomising the gene to explore the space of possibilties, or changing the functions so they are more likely to produce a non-silent result.</div>
<div><h2>Why are there bits of generated code that seem a little pointless/inefficient/nonsensical?</h2></div>
<div>Approximate programming doesn't necessarily make efficient or sensible code, but it all contributes in some way to the final output.</div>
<div><h2>Why doesn't the sound change when I move a value in the gene?</h2></div>
<div>The effect that moving a parameter has on the sound will vary from 'nothing' to 'profound'. Even more confusingly, moving one parameter may make other parameters more or less sensitive than they were before.  It all depends on the functions you're using and they way they've been combined.</div>
<div><h2>There's some clicking when a realtime error is being reported?</h2></div>
<div>The algorithm is failing due to a realtime error in one of the functions (probably the one you're currently editing), causing the clicks. If you can;t fix the error, try switching the function off.</div>
<div><h2>I'm getting audio drop-outs, how can I fix this?</h2></div>
<div>It may be caused by CPU overload; sound synthesis in a web browser can be expensive to compute, especially for older machines.  You could try working with smaller gene sizes, and stick to simple component functions. If you do this, this site should run OK on most machines, even older ones.</div>
