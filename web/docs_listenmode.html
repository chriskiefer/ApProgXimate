Welcome to ApProgXimate Audio.  ApProgXimate Audio is place where you can listen to, explore, create and share new sounds.

You're in 'listen mode', which means you can listen to different 'scenes' and manipulate the sounds.  If you switch to 'create mode' (with the button in the top right corner) you can see all the code that creates the sounds, and program new ones.

<h2>Loading Scenes</h2>

You can listen to different sounds that have been shared online.  Click on the 'load scene' button and select a new one.

<h2>Manipulating Sounds</h2>

You'll see a set of black bars on the screen. You can drag these around to change the sound. There are no labels on the bars, so just explore by listening.

Sometimes a bar may have little or no effect on the sound - this is because of the way the sounds here are made (you can see this for yourself in 'create mode').  Sometimes moving a bar may cause silence; you can reverse this by moving the bar to where it was or reloading the scene.
